# Overview

This project is a simple currency converter that exchanges money from one currency to another using API calls and simple calculations in Rust. I created this program to further my skills and understanding in working with APIs and with coding in Rust. 
The program will prompt the user for a currency that they want to convert their money to from a given list of currencies. Then, depending on their response the program will make an API call to receive the current rate of exchange of their currency and the one they desire to convert to. 
After the API call is made they will receive the exchange rate and be able to choose the amount of money they want to exchange and convert it over. This allows people to know when doing business, traveling, or online shopping how they can use their money and plan more efficiently.
